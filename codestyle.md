# Code style

## C code

- Only strict C89 standard rules  with the exception of the place of definition of variables. Variable should only be defined when used, not earlier then absolutely necessary.
- Function/variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Tabs are not allowed 4 spaces are used instead
- Functions are outlined like:

```
void function_name(int a){
    Ã¬nt b=3*a;
}
```

## Python code
- private variables start with an underscore and are lower caps (example: "_start_time")
- Function/variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

## Matlab code
- Function/variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
